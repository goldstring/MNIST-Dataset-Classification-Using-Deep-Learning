<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of this project is to develop a <strong>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</strong> model to accurately classify handwritten digits from the <strong>MNIST dataset</strong>. The dataset consists of <strong>28x28 grayscale images</strong> of digits ranging from 0 to 9. The objective is to achieve high accuracy in recognizing digits by leveraging CNN architectures known for their effectiveness in image classification tasks.
    </p>
    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
        Handwritten digit recognition is a fundamental problem in computer vision, often used as a benchmark for evaluating deep learning models. The MNIST dataset is widely recognized for this purpose due to its simplicity and relevance.
    </p>
    <h3>Dataset Overview</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The dataset contains <strong>60,000 training images</strong> and <strong>10,000 test images</strong>.</li>
        <li>Each image is a <strong>28x28 pixel grayscale image</strong> labeled with a digit from 0 to 9.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Model Architecture</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to capture spatial hierarchies and patterns within the images.</li>
        <li>The CNN includes key components such as <strong>convolutional layers</strong>, <strong>ReLU activations</strong>, <strong>max-pooling layers</strong>, and <strong>fully connected (dense) layers</strong>.</li>
        <li>The model is trained to minimize the <strong>categorical cross-entropy loss</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preprocessing Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Normalization of pixel values to the range <strong>[0, 1]</strong>.</li>
        <li>Reshaping images to fit the input requirements of the CNN.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Training and Validation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The model is trained using the training dataset with a validation split.</li>
        <li>Techniques like <strong>data augmentation</strong> and <strong>dropout</strong> are used to improve generalization and reduce overfitting.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Evaluation Metrics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The model's performance is evaluated using <strong>accuracy</strong>, <strong>confusion matrix</strong>, and <strong>loss curves</strong> on the test set.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Python</strong> with libraries like <strong>TensorFlow</strong>, <strong>Keras</strong>, and <strong>Matplotlib</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style='color:red;'>Our model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digit images. As a result, if we input digit images in different font styles or formats, the model may produce biased or inaccurate results due to its limited exposure to other types of digit representations.</h2>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        This project demonstrates how CNNs can effectively classify handwritten digits with high accuracy, showcasing the strength of deep learning in solving image recognition problems. The insights gained can be extended to more complex image classification tasks in the future.
